# TreadWater
Tread Water application as a Unity project (C#)
This application was built for iOS but has since been removed from the Apple App Store

Files I've made can be found in the Assets folder, code I wrote is found in the Assests/Scripts folder (.cs files)
all code I wrote for the project was done in C#

The game involves tapping the screen causing the character to jump out of water to avoid drowning.
Ads can be viewed to continue after dying.
